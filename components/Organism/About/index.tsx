              Hello! I'm Ihsan, graduate of Agricultural Engineering, Bogor
              Agriculture University. I became a web development especially
              frontend development starting in June 2021. I started writing my
              first line code in February 2021. At the time i decided to change
              carreers from various job role from sales officer, procurement
              staff, and last job as a digital marketer in Bogor for 2 years to
              be web development. The pandemic forced me to survive more, that's
              why i decided to learn to be a web developer through bootcamps and
              various udemy courses.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-8'>
              Why i chosen Frontend development? because i like something visual
              like UI design, engineering design and other. Many technologies
              can be learn at frontend development, so that makes me exited to
              learn as much as possible. Learn and keep practicing makes me to
              be better.
            </p>
