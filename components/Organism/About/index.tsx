                Hello! I'm Ihsan, graduate of Agricultural Engineering, Bogor Agriculture University. I became a web
                developer especially Frontend Developer starting in June 2021. I started writing my first line code in
                February 2021. At that time I decided to change carreers from various job role starting from sales
                officer, procurement staff, and lastly as a digital marketer in Bogor for 2 years to be a web developer.
                The pandemic forced me to survive more, that's why I decided to learn to be a web developer through
                bootcamps and various udemy courses.

              <motion.p variants={varianMotion(0.3)} initial='before' animate='after' className='mb-8'>
                I chose Frontend development because I like something visual like UI design, engineering design and
                everything related to design. Many technologies can be learn from frontend development and that makes me
                want to learn as much as possible. Learning and keep practicing are two things that make me grow and
                improve.
